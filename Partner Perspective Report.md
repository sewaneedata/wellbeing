# Partner Perspective Report
## Well-being Dream Team: Temi Adejumobi, Jarely Soriano, Michael Komnick, and Sam Dean
### June 15th, 2022

We believe that flourishing is key to student health and success. In the words of our partner, Dr. Nicole Noffsinger-Frazier, 

“Flourishing is the presence of positivity, having good connections with others, and having mastery over one’s environment. It’s not a trait—it’s a state or spectrum of well-being that we have to work on daily.” 

Flourishing isn’t easy to accomplish, especially for college students. Our goal is to help Sewanee find out what helps and impairs a student’s flourishing so that we may effectively promote flourishing on our campus. In order to gauge what the social and emotional climate is like for students, Dr. Noffsinger-Frazier is partnering with Sewanee DataLab to analyze mental health survey data from Sewanee Students. 

For the past five years, Sewanee undergrad students have been filling out the Healthy Minds Survey (HMS), a survey that asks questions about mental health outcomes, knowledge and attitudes about mental health and service utilization. The HMS is used by a network of colleges and emphasizes understanding help-seeking behavior, examining stigma, knowledge, and other potential barriers to mental health service utilization. The five years of extensive HMS data we have will allow us to find correlations between student health, substance use, academic success, and flourishing.

As the Associate Dean of Student Flourishing and Wellness, Dr. Noffsinger-Frazier is responsible for observing the overall wellness of the Sewanee community and finding new ways to improve it. So far, She has promoted wellness through fitness classes like ‘Cycling Under the Stars’, teaching health courses like ‘Foundations of Flourishing and Wellbeing’, and health care: through traditional office visits as well as providing every Sewanee student with a free mental telehealth health app called Sanvello. She hopes to define what it means for Sewanee students to “flourish” by incorporating Harvard University’s Eight Dimensions of Well-being. Then, hopes to provide the pathways for Sewanee students to achieve it. 

At the end of her partnership with DataLab, she would like a Health Minds Survey (HMS) database that enables her to analyze student flourishing across the years, driven by student mental and physical health markers. She would also like a dashboard of the HMS data to display publicly on the Wellness Commons webpage. She hopes this information will equip her with the insights and information needed to build future research projects to determine pathways to flourishing at Sewanee.
