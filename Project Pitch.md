# Project Pitch Script 
We’re Temi, Michael, Sam and Jarely! And we’re the Well-being Dream Team!

Sewanee has fostered some of the greatest academics and so many are flourishing and thrive! But how? What can we learn from those who are thriving? Over the past decade, the rate of depression, anxiety and serious thoughts of suicide has doubled among college students, according to Daniel Eisenberg, a professor at U.C.L.A. and a principal investigator of the Healthy Minds Study, an annual survey of thousands of students across the country. (Hartocollis, New York Times 2021)

What could be causing this? Overburdened resources? not knowing what resources are available? lack of education on what well-being is and how to achieve it? Our job is to find out.

We will use this data to extract insights on the current state of flourishing for Sewanee students. We hope to find patterns that can help students improve their flourishing.

The data will be used to publish findings that are accessible and transparent to the public for the first time via an interactive dashboard. This will show us how Sewanee can improve but also where it is doing well (where are we flourishing, and where are we lacking). Our job is to use insights derived from student surveys to better understand ways in which we could improve as an institution such as problem areas to target and additional services to provide. We will demonstrate the status of student flourishing currently by making this information available for all audiences including parents, students, and the university administration. We hope our work can be used as a springboard in brainstorming possible solutions to problems specifically at Sewanee, with the hopes of our work having a positive impact on student well-being at Sewanee and possibly other institutions.

Dr. Nicole Noffsinger-Frazier, now the associate Dean of Flourishing is our DataLab partner and Dr. Gray, the senior director of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title Ix is our project mentor. There isn't a more passionate group of people for this project! 

We’re at an age and in an environment that determines our habits as adults. We can revolutionize how we think about life at college and set students up for fostering healthy lives. It’s critical in this moment now more than ever to divert our attention to make wellness information and resources easy and free to understand and access
