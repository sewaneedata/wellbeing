## About

We are project Wellbeing for the DataLab Summer of 2022.

## Problem Statement

College students are experiencing mental health crises at unprecedented rates. We will analyze student survey data to generate insights into the most pressing student well-being issues at Sewanee and make them, as well as the current state and trends, available to our students, parents, and educators.
